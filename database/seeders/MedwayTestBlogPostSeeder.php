Which Grammar Schools in Medway Use the Test?

All six grammar schools within the Medway Council authority utilise the Medway Test as part of their admissions process:

Chatham Grammar School
Fort Pitt Grammar School
Holcombe Grammar School
Rainham Mark Grammar School
Rochester Grammar School
Sir Joseph Williamson’s Mathematical School
Important Note on Co-education: Exciting changes are on the horizon! While Chatham Grammar School, Fort Pitt Grammar School, and Holcombe Grammar School are currently single-sex institutions (boys or girls only), they will become fully co-educational from September 2026. This means that for the autumn 2025 application window for 2026 entry, boys and girls can apply to all six Medway grammar schools.

Understanding the Medway Test:

The Medway Test is an 11 plus entrance examination specifically designed and used by the grammar schools within the Medway Council authority. A significant advantage is that your child only needs to take this test once, regardless of how many Medway grammar schools they are applying to.

Typically administered in September of Year 6, the test arrangements differ slightly depending on your child\'s current schooling. If your child attends a Medway primary school, they will likely sit the test at their own school during the regular school week. For children who attend schools outside of Medway, they will be allocated a test centre within the Medway area, usually a local school, where they will take the exam on a weekend.

Important Context: If your child is also considering grammar schools in neighbouring Kent, Bexley, or Bromley, be aware that these areas administer separate 11 plus exams. You can find more information about these tests here on Oatutors.co.uk:

Bromley 11+ exams
What Does the Medway Test Assess?

The Medway Test comprises three distinct papers:

1. English:

This section evaluates skills and knowledge aligned with the Key Stage 2 national curriculum. Expect to see:

Reading Comprehension: Assessing your child\'s ability to understand and interpret written passages.
Vocabulary, Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar: Questions designed to test their grasp of these fundamental language elements.
Consistent and varied reading is invaluable preparation for this section. Encouraging your child to explore different genres and authors will enhance their analytical skills, vocabulary, inference abilities, comprehension, and imagination.

2. Maths:

The maths paper focuses on the content covered in Key Stage 2 maths lessons. Your child should have a solid understanding of:

The Four Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Fractions and Decimals
Percentages and Ratio
Geometry: Including area, perimeter, and various measurements.
While the topics themselves will be familiar, the questions may present them in more challenging ways, requiring your child to apply their existing knowledge to solve novel problems.

3. Reasoning:

This section is typically divided into two components:

Verbal Reasoning: This involves analyzing written information, such as letters, words, numbers, and symbols, to identify patterns and solve logical problems.
Non-Verbal Reasoning: This focuses on visual information, such as shapes, pictures, and diagrams, requiring your child to identify relationships and apply logical thinking.
It\'s important to note that verbal and non-verbal reasoning are not typically part of the standard primary school curriculum. Grammar schools include these tests to assess a child\'s underlying potential and logical thinking abilities, rather than solely their learned knowledge.

How is the Medway Test Scored?

The scoring process for the Medway Test involves several stages:

Raw Scores: Initially, each of the three papers (English, Maths, and Reasoning) is marked to determine a raw score, which is simply the total number of correct answers.

Age-Standardisation: To ensure fairness for children of different ages within the year group, the raw scores are then age-standardised. This process takes into account your child\'s exact age in years and months at the time of the test, resulting in three standardised scores (one for each paper).

Weighted Score: Finally, these age-standardised scores are combined to create a total \'weighted\' score. The formula used for this calculation is:

(Standardised English score×2)+(Standardised Maths score×2)+(Standardised Reasoning score×1)

Understanding the Pass Mark:

The pass mark for the Medway Test is not a fixed number and can only be determined after all the tests have been marked and the weighted scores have been ranked. It fluctuates each year based on the overall performance and the size of the cohort taking the test.

Historically, the pass mark was set around the 23rd percentile, meaning that the top 23% of children based on their weighted scores were deemed eligible for grammar school places. A further 2% could sometimes be selected through a review process.

However, for Year 7 entry in 2025 and beyond, the minimum score was set at the 25th percentile (the top 25% of the cohort). For entry in September 2026, the minimum score will be at the 26th percentile.

To give you a general idea, here are the lowest total weighted scores of children who were offered places at Medway grammar schools in recent years:

2025 Entry: 482
2024 Entry: 492
2023 Entry: 488
2022 Entry: 487
2021 Entry: 483
2020 Entry: 490
Important Consideration: Achieving the minimum score does not guarantee a place at your preferred school. Medway grammar schools are highly sought after and often oversubscribed with students who meet the minimum entry requirements. We strongly advise you to carefully review the individual admissions policies of your target schools to understand their specific criteria and how places are allocated.

The completed application form must be submitted to your home local council by the national deadline of 31st October 2025.
3. National School Offer Day:

On 2nd March 2026, you will be notified which secondary school your child has been offered a place at.
Places are allocated based on your ranked preferences, provided your child meets the entry criteria and the school has available spaces.
If none of your preferred schools have places available, your child will be offered a place at another school within your area.
You have the right to appeal the decision through an independent panel if you are unhappy with the allocated school.
How Can You Support Your Child's Preparation for the Medway Test?

The Medway Test is designed to be challenging, but effective preparation can significantly boost your child's confidence. Here are some of our top tips for supporting your child in the lead-up to the exam in September 2025:

Embrace Bitesize Learning: Consistent, short study sessions are more effective than infrequent, long ones. Child psychologists recommend study periods of 20-30 minutes for children aged 10-11. Consider utilizing online platforms like Atom Home, which offers engaging and adaptive learning experiences.

Cultivate a Love of Reading: Regular and diverse reading is fundamental for developing the analytical and comprehension skills assessed in the English paper. Encourage your child to explore various genres and authors to broaden their vocabulary and understanding of different writing styles.

Refine Exam Technique Through Practice: Once your child has a solid grasp of the Key Stage 2 curriculum, practice tests are invaluable. They help develop problem-solving skills, build confidence under timed conditions, and identify areas where further focus is needed. Platforms like Atom Home offer online mock tests with automatic marking and printable practice papers to simulate the real exam environment.

Celebrate Progress and Foster a Growth Mindset: Acknowledge and celebrate your child's efforts and achievements, no matter how small. Encourage a growth mindset by emphasizing that learning from mistakes is part of the process and that improvement comes with practice and perseverance. Regular praise will build resilience and confidence when tackling challenging topics.
